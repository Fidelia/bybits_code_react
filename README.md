**An estimate of how long you spent on this task:**
The initial plan and skeleton of the application took less than an hour, but the integration of the two API endpoints took more than 4 hours which was longer than expected.

**If you ran out of time or wanted to spend more time, what would you have liked to have done?**
I ran out of time and would have liked to generate the mock policy details from the policy API, and then print to the policy details page.
